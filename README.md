Due Sunday, March 26, 2017

## simple-xlsx
My name: Kshitij Karke

Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:

Initially I tried to look up some sort of an API for twitter, I did some reasearch and
found this https://lists.racket-lang.org/users/archive/2013-May/057838.html

Part of the step was to wait for an authorization key, I should have started before Sunday
and after deciding to wait a while for the key I completely forgot that the deadline for
FP3 was on Sunday.

The only reason I wanted to get this working is so we could somehow implement parsing tweets
of people online, when a stock (for example Apple) starts moving up or down people on twitter
start talking more about the stock on twitter and tag their thoughts using a $ (for example $APPL)

I tried again Monday and on Tuesday night decided to give something else a try, I tried to get familiar with simple-xlsx. Maybe in my project I can integrate sending the user a snapshot of their portfolio. 

This is when I came across the 
* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. 

You need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be uploaded to your repository, and then displayed with markdown in this file; like this:

![test image](/testimage.bmp?raw=true "test image")
